\title{Plot Codon Usage Bias and RSCU in a Unified Panel}
\usage{
plot_codon_usage_panel(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame or tibble with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{codon}: character, codon sequence (e.g. "AAA")
\item \code{frequency}: numeric, codon usage frequency
\item \code{aa}: character, translated amino acid (single-letter code)
}}
}
\value{
A patchwork object combining three ggplot panels.
}
\description{
This function generates a clean, publication-ready multi-panel visualization
summarizing codon usage bias and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).
The figure integrates absolute usage, codon-level RSCU, and amino-acid-level
RSCU distributions while avoiding redundant encodings.
}
\details{
Panels included:
\enumerate{
\item Absolute codon usage aggregated by amino acid
\item Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) per codon, faceted by amino acid
\item Distribution of RSCU values per amino acid
}

RSCU is computed as:
\deqn{RSCU = \frac{f_{codon}}{mean(f_{synonymous})}}
}
