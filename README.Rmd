**GeneScout** is an R package for identifying hidden genes in non-coding DNA
using statistical information theory. It implements sliding window entropy
scanning, Shannon entropy estimation, and Kullback–Leibler divergence
to discover potential small open reading frames (sORFs) directly from genomic
sequences without requiring prior annotation.

<!-- Most existing bioinformatics tools for codon usage analysis, such as -->
<!-- **coRdon**, are designed to operate on *known* protein-coding genes derived -->
<!-- from annotated GTF or GFF files. Core infrastructure packages such as -->
<!-- **Biostrings** provide efficient manipulation of biological sequences but do -->
<!-- not offer functionality for genome-wide *de novo* discovery of coding regions. -->
<!-- Consequently, these tools are not optimized for systematic exploration of -->
<!-- large, unannotated genomic regions. -->

Most existing bioinformatics tools for codon usage bias analysis (like
`coRdon` and `Biostrings`) are designed for analyzing **known** genes from
annotated GTF/GFF files. They are not optimized for **discovery** in
non-coding regions.

<!-- **GeneScout fills this methodological gap** by focusing on *de novo* small ORF -->
<!-- discovery through statistical modeling of local codon usage patterns in large -->
<!-- genomic regions. -->

**GeneScout fills this gap** by focusing on *de novo* small ORF discovery in
large genomic regions.

Here are the key features of the tool has:

- **Sliding window entropy scanning**: This implementation efficiently scan 
millions of base pairs to find regions with unusual codon usage patterns
- **Shannon entropy calculation**: This quantifies the randomness of codon 
distributions within genomic windows. 
- **Kullback-Leibler divergence**: Compare regions to organism-specific codon 
usage profiles.
<!-- Compares local codon usage to organism-specific reference profiles -->
- **ORF detection**: Identifies candidate open reading frames within 
low-entropy regions
- **Reference profile construction** Builds organism-specific codon usage 
profiles from known coding sequences

## Installation

```r
# install development version
devtools::install_github("danymukesha/GeneScout")
```

## Quick Start

```r
library(GeneScout)

# Create a reference profile from known genes
known_genes <- c("ATGATGATG", "GCCGCCGCC", "TTATTATTA")
ref_profile <- create_reference_profile(known_genes)

# Scan a genomic sequence
sequence <- paste(rep("ATGATGATGTTATTATTACGCCGCCGCC", 30), collapse = "")
scan_result <- sliding_window_scan(
  sequence,
  window_size = 300,
  step_size = 30,
  reference_profile = ref_profile
)

# Detect entropy peaks
peaks <- entropy_peak_detection(scan_result, threshold = 0.1)

# Find candidate ORFs
candidates <- find_candidate_orfs(sequence, scan_result, peaks)

# Visualize results
plot_candidate_orfs(scan_result, candidates, peaks)
```

## Theory

### Shannon Entropy

$$H = -\sum_{i=1}^{64} P(i) \log_2 P(i)$$

- **High entropy** (~6 bits): Random codon usage → non-coding DNA
- **Low entropy** (~3-4 bits): Biased codon usage → potential gene/coding 
regions

### Kullback-Leibler Divergence

$$D_{KL}(P \| Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log_2 \left( \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)} \right)$$

Compares the observed codon distribution ($P$) to the reference distribution ($Q$).
There are different use cases, few of them would be:

1.  **De novo gene discovery**: to find potential coding regions in
    unannotated genomes
2.  **Small ORF identification**: for discovering small peptides in
    non-coding regions
3.  **Comparative genomics**: comparing codon usage between organisms
4.  **RNA-Seq integration**: validating candidate ORFs with expression
    data
5.  **Evolutionary studies**: to analze codon usage patterns across
    lineages
